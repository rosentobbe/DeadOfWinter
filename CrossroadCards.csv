On a result of 2 or lower that survivor receives 1 wound.",,
78,Loretta Clay,If the player controls Loretta and she is not exiled:,"""Where did we find these cans?"" Loretta says angrily. ""I have almost thirty cans well past their expiration date. If you hunters don't do your job and look, then it messes everything up. We were counting on this food!""","Loretta cooks the food anyway. Roll a die. On a result of 5 or higher the food is not only good but Loretta does and exceptional job of preparing it. Gain 1 morale. On a result of 3-4 the food isn't any worse than usual. Nothing happens. On a result of 1-2, food poisoning runs rampant through the colony. Every non-helpless survivor at the colony must roll a die. On a result of 1-2 they receive 1 wound.",,She swears angrily and throws the cans out. Remove 1 food from the supply.,,
79,Fuel Tanker,If the player moves a non-exiled survivor:,"""Holy crap."" The fuel tanker sits just off the road, and it appears in excellent condition. You exit your car, and checking the perimeter you approach the cab, it's driver side door hanging open. You slice the seat belt apart, and bludgeon the head of the zombie that falls out. The trucker's bloody hat says Beaver Inspector, and you marvel al how stupid and frivolous your species used to be. Climbing into the cab you give the keys a twist and the loud diesel engine roars to life like some ancient monster reborn into the world. You cringe. Noise like that is going to draw every dead thing for a mile.","You drive the tanker back to the colony, drawing every zombie in the area back with you. Place 6 zombies at the colony and add up to 4 fuel cards that have been removed from the game to your hand.",,You sigh regretfully and tum the motor back off. It's just too loud to risk driving into the colony. Nothing happens.,,
80,Harman Brooks,If Harman Brooks is in play and is not exiled:,"""No more shoveling trash or building barricades. I need to get out and do what I do best.""","Harman lays flat on his platform, and feels it sway in the winter wind. He gazes down from his treetop vantage point at the specially laid snare below, and steels himself for a long wait. Add 3 food to the supply.",,"Thorns snag at Harman's sleeves as he pushes through a thick tangle of greenery. After long hours he is beginning to give up hope, but then he spots a promising sprout at the base of an old oak tree. Kneeling, he plucks a leaf and chews it. Perfect! Now if he can just collect several dozen more plants, he might be able to make a decent salve. Remove 1 wound from up to 3 survivors.",,
